# Final Fixes Applied to inrep Package and Hildesheim Study

## 1. Later Package as Required Dependency

### Changes Made:
- Added `later` to the Imports section in DESCRIPTION file
- Removed all fallback logic for when `later` is not available
- Package now loads `later` immediately at startup

### Files Modified:
- `DESCRIPTION`: Added `later (>= 1.3.0)` to Imports
- `R/launch_study.R`: 
  - Simplified to always use `later::later()` without checks
  - Removed conditional loading logic
  - Package loads immediately with `library(later)`

## 2. PDF Download Fix in Hildesheim Study

### Problem:
The PDF download button was not working - clicking "Als PDF speichern" did nothing.

### Solution:
- Fixed JavaScript code to properly access jsPDF library
- Added error handling and console logging
- Added loading indicator while PDF is being generated
- Fixed the onclick handler to use `window.downloadReport()`

### Key Changes in `case_studies/hildesheim_study/hildesheim_production.R`:
```javascript
// Changed from:
const pdf = new jspdf.jsPDF("p", "mm", "a4");

// To:
const { jsPDF } = window.jspdf;
const pdf = new jsPDF("p", "mm", "a4");
```

- Added library availability checks
- Added error messages in German for user feedback
- Added automatic library reloading if not initially loaded

## 3. Cloud Storage and Data Saving

### Problem:
Data was not being saved to the cloud storage.

### Solution:
- Fixed WebDAV URL format (changed from share link to WebDAV endpoint)
- Added explicit cloud storage configuration in study_config
- Implemented data saving and upload directly in create_hilfo_report function

### Configuration Added:
```r
study_config <- create_study_config(
  # ... other config ...
  save_to_file = TRUE,
  save_format = "csv",
  cloud_storage = TRUE,
  enable_download = TRUE
)
```

### WebDAV URL Fixed:
- From: `https://sync.academiccloud.de/index.php/s/inrep_test/`
- To: `https://sync.academiccloud.de/remote.php/dav/files/inrep_test/`

### Data Upload Implementation:
- Data is saved locally as CSV with timestamp
- Uploaded to cloud using httr::PUT with authentication
- Upload happens asynchronously using later::later()
- Includes all 48 variables plus calculated scores

## 4. Console Output Cleanup

### Removed:
- All checkmark symbols from console output
- All emoji usage throughout the package
