\description{
Creates a comprehensive deployment package for launching adaptive assessment studies
on the inrep platform. This function generates all necessary files and configurations
for professional hosting of TAM-based adaptive assessments. The resulting package
can be deployed on the official inrep platform or any compatible Shiny server.
}
\details{
This function creates a complete deployment package that includes:
\itemize{
  \item Study configuration and metadata
  \item Item bank validation and preparation
  \item UI components with professional styling
  \item Assessment logic and scoring algorithms
  \item Results processing and reporting systems
  \item Quality assurance and validation checks
  \item Deployment documentation and instructions
}

The generated package is designed for professional deployment on:
\itemize{
  \item Official inrep platform (contact: selva@uni-hildesheim.de)
  \item Posit Connect / RStudio Connect servers
  \item ShinyApps.io
  \item Custom Shiny Server installations
  \item Docker containers for scalable deployment
}

For official inrep platform deployment, users should contact the maintainer
at selva@uni-hildesheim.de with the generated deployment package and provide:
\itemize{
  \item Brief study description and objectives
  \item Expected study duration and participant numbers
  \item Special requirements (multilingual support, accessibility, etc.)
  \item Institutional affiliation and research context
}
