\title{Create Demographics UI Interface for Assessment Workflow}
\usage{
create_demographics_ui(demographics, input_types)
}
\arguments{
\item{demographics}{A character vector specifying demographic fields to
collect (e.g., \code{c("Age", "Gender", "Education")}). If \code{NULL},
returns a "Start Test" button to proceed directly to assessment.}

\item{input_types}{A named list specifying input types for each demographic
field. Names should match \code{demographics} vector, values should be
\code{"numeric"}, \code{"select"}, or \code{"text"}. Example:
\code{list(Age = "numeric", Gender = "select", Education = "text")}.}
}
\value{
A Shiny UI element containing:
\describe{
  \item{Input components}{Formatted demographic inputs based on specified types}
  \item{Start button}{Action button to proceed to assessment ("Start Test")}
  \item{Validation}{ Built-in validation for required fields}
}
If \code{demographics} is \code{NULL}, returns only the "Start Test" button.
}
\description{
Generates comprehensive Shiny UI components for demographic data collection
as part of the assessment workflow. Creates standardized input interfaces
that integrate seamlessly with TAM-based psychometric assessments while
maintaining accessibility standards and research best practices.
}
\details{
This function creates standardized demographic collection interfaces that
support research requirements while maintaining participant experience quality:

\strong{Demographic Input Types:}
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Numeric}: Age, years of experience, education years
  \item \strong{Select}: Gender, education level, employment status
  \item \strong{Text}: Open-ended fields like occupation, comments
}

\strong{Research Standards:}
\itemize{
  \item Consistent labeling and formatting across studies
  \item Validation-ready for data quality assurance
  \item Integration with IRT-Based Assessment workflows
  \item Support for IRB-compliant data collection practices
}

\strong{Accessibility Features:}
\itemize{
  \item Clear labels and logical tab order
  \item Screen reader compatibility
  \item Mobile-responsive design
  \item High contrast and keyboard navigation support
}

\strong{Workflow Integration:}
\itemize{
  \item Seamless transition to assessment items
  \item Data validation before proceeding
  \item Integration with session management
  \item Support for resume/save functionality
}

The generated interface automatically handles the transition from demographic
collection to the main assessment, ensuring proper data validation and
session state management.
}
\section{Data Validation}{

The function creates inputs with built-in validation:
\itemize{
  \item Numeric inputs: Range validation and type checking
  \item Select inputs: Predefined options with placeholder handling
  \item Text inputs: Length limits and character validation
  \item Required field checking before assessment proceeds
}
}

\section{Integration with Assessment}{

The demographics UI integrates with the main assessment workflow:
\itemize{
  \item Automatic transition to test items after completion
  \item Data storage in reactive values for analysis
  \item Session state management for interruption recovery
  \item Integration with TAM-based ability estimation context
}
}
