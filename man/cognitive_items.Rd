\title{Cognitive Assessment Item Bank}
\format{
A data frame with 50 rows and 5 variables:
\describe{
  \item{item_id}{Character. Unique identifier for each item (COG_001 to COG_050)}
  \item{content}{Character. Item text/description for cognitive tasks}
  \item{domain}{Character. Cognitive domain classification:
    \itemize{
      \item Verbal_Reasoning - Language comprehension and analogies
      \item Numerical_Reasoning - Mathematical problem solving
      \item Spatial_Reasoning - Visual-spatial pattern recognition  
      \item Working_Memory - Short-term memory and manipulation
      \item Processing_Speed - Rapid cognitive processing tasks
    }
  }
  \item{difficulty}{Numeric. Item difficulty parameter (b) for 2PL model, 
    ranging from approximately -3.2 to 2.7}
  \item{discrimination}{Numeric. Item discrimination parameter (a) for 2PL model,
    ranging from approximately 0.8 to 2.4}

Simulated data based on typical cognitive assessment parameters found in
psychometric literature. Item content represents common cognitive task types
used in research and clinical practice.

\description{
A comprehensive item bank for cognitive assessment containing 50 items
across five cognitive domains, calibrated using the 2PL IRT model.
}
\details{
This dataset represents a typical cognitive assessment battery with items
designed to measure different aspects of cognitive ability. The items are
calibrated using the 2-Parameter Logistic (2PL) Item Response Theory model,
making them suitable for adaptive testing implementations.

Each cognitive domain contains 10 items:
\itemize{
  \item Items 1-10: Verbal Reasoning tasks
  \item Items 11-20: Numerical Reasoning problems
  \item Items 21-30: Spatial Reasoning puzzles
  \item Items 31-40: Working Memory challenges
  \item Items 41-50: Processing Speed tasks
}

The difficulty parameters are centered around 0 (mean = 0.04) with a 
standard deviation of approximately 1.2, providing good coverage across
the ability spectrum. Discrimination parameters range from 0.8 to 2.4,
indicating items with varying precision for ability estimation.
