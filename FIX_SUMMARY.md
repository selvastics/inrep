# Fix Summary - R Package Build Error

## Problem
The R package `inrep` was failing to build with a parse error at line 1817 in `launch_study.R`:
```
Error in parse(...) : 
  launch_study.R:1817:42: unexpected Symbol
1816:           // Add scroll-to-top functionality for page changes
1817:           Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler("scrollToTop
                                               ^
```

## Root Cause
JavaScript code (lines 1812-1962) was incorrectly placed outside of an HTML() block in the R file. This raw JavaScript in an R file caused the parser to fail.

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed the HTML block structure**: The JavaScript code that was orphaned (lines 1812-1962) was properly wrapped in a new `shiny::tags$script(HTML("..."))` block.

2. **Key changes made**:
   - Line 1810: Added proper closing `"))` for the first JavaScript block
   - Line 1814: Started a new `shiny::tags$script(HTML("` block for the remaining JavaScript
   - Line 1966: The existing closing `"))` now properly closes this block
   - Changed double quotes to single quotes in `addCustomMessageHandler('scrollToTop'` to avoid quote conflicts

## Verification
- The JavaScript code is now properly contained within HTML() blocks
- All performance optimizations remain intact:
  - Immediate positioning to prevent corner flash
  - Stable styles applied on load
  - Fast launch optimizations preserved
- The file structure is now syntactically correct for R parsing

## Result
The package should now build successfully without parse errors while maintaining all performance optimizations for fast launches.
