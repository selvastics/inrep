# HilFo Study - Fixes Applied

## Date: September 11, 2025

## Issues Reported:
1. **Language mixing**: Personal code page showing German text in English mode
2. **Report generation crash**: ggplot2 error when creating radar plot
3. **Data preservation errors**: "Argument hat LÃ¤nge 0" errors throughout session
4. **Cloud storage concerns**: Need to verify data is saved to cloud and CSV export works

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Language Mixing Fix (Lines 815-834)
**Problem**: The personal code page had hardcoded German text that wasn't being translated.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the static German text after the `data-lang` spans
- Added `class="bilingual-text"` to all elements with language-specific content
- The spans now only contain the `data-lang-de` and `data-lang-en` attributes without duplicate text

**Changes**:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<span data-lang-de="Text" data-lang-en="Text">German Text</span>

<!-- After -->
<span data-lang-de="Text" data-lang-en="Text"></span>
```

### 2. Report Generation Crash Fix (Lines 1237-1246)
**Problem**: The code was trying to add ggplot2 elements incorrectly to a ggradar plot object.

**Solution**:
- Changed from using `ggplot2::labs()` to `ggplot2::ggtitle()` for adding the title
- Restructured the code to properly chain ggplot2 functions
- Added comment explaining that ggradar returns a ggplot object

**Changes**:
```r
# Before
radar_plot <- radar_plot + 
    ggplot2::theme(...) +
    ggplot2::labs(title = ...)

# After  
radar_plot <- radar_plot + 
    ggplot2::ggtitle(...) +
    ggplot2::theme(...)
```

### 3. Data Preservation Fix (Lines 1899-1901)
**Problem**: The complete_data wasn't being stored globally for CSV downloads.

**Solution**:
- Added explicit assignment to global environment after creating complete_data
- Added debug logging to confirm data storage

**Changes**:
```r
# Added after line 1897
assign("complete_data", complete_data, envir = .GlobalEnv)
cat("DEBUG: complete_data stored globally with", ncol(complete_data), "columns and", nrow(complete_data), "rows\n")
```

### 4. CSV Download Handler Improvement (Line 3203)
**Problem**: The CSV download handler wasn't properly checking for reactive values.

**Solution**:
- Changed condition from checking if rv exists in global environment to checking if rv is not null
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting

**Changes**:
```r
# Before
} else if (exists("rv", envir = .GlobalEnv)) {

# After
} else if (!is.null(rv)) {
    # Try to reconstruct from reactive values
    cat("DEBUG: Attempting to reconstruct data from reactive values\n")
```

## Cloud Storage Configuration
The application is configured to save data to:
- **WebDAV URL**: https://sync.academiccloud.de/public.php/webdav/
- **Share Token**: OUarlqGbhYopkBc
- **Password**: ws2526

Data is automatically uploaded after each completed survey session.

## Testing Recommendations:

1. **Test Language Switching**:
   - Start in German mode
   - Switch to English on page 2
   - Verify personal code page (page 20) shows English text
   - Check all bilingual elements update properly

2. **Test Report Generation**:
   - Complete all survey pages
   - Verify the radar plot generates without errors
   - Check that all scores are calculated correctly

3. **Test Data Saving**:
   - Complete a full survey
   - Click "Download CSV" button
   - Verify CSV contains all responses and calculated scores
   - Check cloud storage for uploaded file

4. **Test Session Recovery**:
   - Start a survey
   - Close browser mid-survey
   - Return and verify data is preserved

## Additional Notes:
- All error messages should now be properly handled
- The application should be more robust against missing or invalid data
- Language switching should work consistently throughout the application
