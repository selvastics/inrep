## Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to use **inrep** to conduct comparative studies between different psychological constructs. We'll examine the relationship between mathematical ability and personality traits, showcasing how adaptive testing can efficiently assess multiple domains and reveal their interconnections.

## Study Rationale

### Research Questions

1. How do mathematical abilities relate to Big Five personality traits?
2. Can adaptive testing efficiently assess both cognitive and personality domains?
3. What are the optimal assessment strategies for multi-domain studies?
4. How do these relationships vary across different populations?

### Theoretical Background

Mathematical ability and personality traits represent distinct but potentially related psychological domains:

- **Mathematical Ability**: Cognitive capacity for quantitative reasoning, problem-solving, and mathematical operations
- **Personality Traits**: Stable individual differences in behavior, cognition, and emotion (Big Five model)

Research suggests connections between these domains, particularly:
- **Conscientiousness** and academic achievement in mathematics
- **Openness** and mathematical creativity and problem-solving
- **Neuroticism** and math anxiety effects on performance

## Multi-Domain Study Design

### Configuring Dual Assessment

```{r}
library(inrep)

# Create comprehensive study configuration
math_personality_study <- create_study_config(
  name = "Mathematics and Personality Adaptive Assessment",
  
  # Multi-domain assessment structure
  domains = list(
    mathematics = list(
      model = "2PL",  # 2-Parameter Logistic for dichotomous math items
      max_items = 25,
      min_items = 15,
      min_SEM = 0.4,
      content_areas = c("algebra", "geometry", "statistics", "calculus")
    ),
    
    personality = list(
      model = "GRM",  # Graded Response Model for personality items
      max_items = 30,
      min_items = 20,
      min_SEM = 0.4,
      traits = c("extraversion", "agreeableness", "conscientiousness", 
                "neuroticism", "openness")
    )
  ),
  
  # Assessment ordering
  administration = list(
    domain_order = "randomized",  # Random order to control sequence effects
    break_between_domains = TRUE,
    estimated_total_time = "45-60 minutes"
  ),
  
  # Population and recruitment
  target_population = list(
    age_range = c(16, 25),
    education_level = "high_school_university",
    mathematical_background = "varied",
    recruitment_strategy = "stratified_sampling"
  )

```

### Loading Multi-Domain Item Banks

```{r}
# Load mathematical ability items
data("math_items", package = "inrep")  # Hypothetical math item bank

# Load personality items  
if (!exists("bfi_items")) data("bfi_items", package = "inrep")   # Big Five personality items

# Validate both item banks
math_validation <- validate_item_bank(
  item_bank = math_items,
  model = "2PL",
  content_areas = c("algebra", "geometry", "statistics", "calculus")
)

personality_validation <- validate_item_bank(
  item_bank = bfi_items,
  model = "GRM", 
  min_categories = 4
)

print(math_validation)
print(personality_validation)
```
