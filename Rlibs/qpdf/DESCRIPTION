Description: Content-preserving transformations transformations of PDF files such 
    as split, combine, and compress. This package interfaces directly to the 'qpdf' 
    C++ library <https://qpdf.sourceforge.io/> and does not require any command 
    line utilities. Note that 'qpdf' does not read actual content from PDF files: 
    to extract text and data you need the 'pdftools' package.
